# Dockerized ETL project

# A simple Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline built with:
  * Python - data extraction, transformation, and loading logic
  * Postgres - database for storing transformed data
  * Docker & Docker Compose - containerized and reproducible environment
### This project demonstrates how to build and run an end-to-end ETL pipelinee with isolated servics for the databasee and pipeline, connected via Docker networking





### ETL project with tools:
  * Python 
  * Postgres
  * Docker
  * Dbeaveer or any SQL client to connect and inspect the database

### Step by step on how to run the pipeline:
  * Clone the repository
  * git clone [Repository](https://github.com/Ayomi-tech/dockerized-etl-project.git)
  * cd etl-docker-project

  ### Make the script executable:
  * chmod +x run_pipeline.sh

  ### Run the pipeline:
  * ./run_pipeline.sh
